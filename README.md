# M.Sc._Multivariate_Analysis_Project
Assignment on Multivariate Analysis Paper during M.Sc. in UOH (2018-2020)

**Start Date:** 18-10-2019

**End Date:** 08-11-2019

**Project Guide:** Prof. M. Bhattacharjee

During the Masters Programme (2018-2020) at University of Hyderabad, I did a Data Analysis project for the paper of Multivariate Analysis in Semester - III.

While carrying out this project, the primary steps were: 
1. Collection of multiple real life dataset, and studying their background. 
2. Selection of a dataset - "Emission of Green House by all sectors, worldwide". 
3. After choosing the data, examining and understanding the data characteristics. 
4. Finding out the purpose of the analysis from the chosen dataset. 
5. Explanatory Data Analysis. 
6. Basic and Advanced Analysis.

The progress of this project was maintained on a day to day basis through a **Progress Report**. After the completion of the project, a final **Project Report** was submitted to the Project Guide, followed by a class **Presentation**.

##**Brief Summary of Project work**##

*Dataset:* Global Greenhouse gas emission from FAOSTAT
http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EM

*Objective:* To carry out analysis based on Multivariate Techniques

*Steps:*
1. Data Pre Processing and Cleaning, included structured and reshaped the data. 
2. Carried out Explanatory Data Analysis, based on GHG resources, countries etc. 
3. Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for Dimensional Reduction. 
4. Basic analysis for Modelling and Prediction was carried out using MANOVA and Multiple Regression. 
5. For advanced analysis, applied time series techniques to forecast the future emission values of GHG.

*Technology used:* **R**
